# Text2Code - Ren'Py Edition
A basic python program utilizing regex that transforms text documents into Ren'Py game code to promote a better development workflow.

When developing any Ren'Py game, independent developers are often tasked with juggling their game's narrative script alongside their code. While some independent developers eventually find their preferred workflow, many solo devs give up due to the sheer amount of things they must manage. To help these struggling devs, I decided to create *Text2Code - Ren'Py Edition* which gives developer the flexibility of writing their story scripts outside of their preferred text editor while limiting their need to micromanage tedious Ren'Py code.
